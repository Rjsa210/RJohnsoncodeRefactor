# Week 1 homework: CodeRefactor
## **Reid Johnson**
### UTSA Web Development Boot Camp

For this weeks assignment I learned several things through my process of refactoring the website. First of all, everytime I make a few changes I should git commit. Also, I learned to first make any syntax changes that don't affect the operation of the code, as it makes it easier to further streamline the code if redundant processes are consolidated.

Initially, I began  by consolidating the .CSS,
combining selectors, and making the code more efficient; while making sure the changes I made maintained the appearance of the website. Also I added alt attributes to all the images

Next, I sectioned of the HTML with comments where I intended to replace `<div>` elements.  I then replaced `<div>` elements with semantic elements. Ultimately I was able to replace every `<div>` tag in the HTML with an appropriate semantic tag.

While working my way through the HTML, I regularly returned to the CSS to rename selectors with the appropriate updated tags.

Unfortunately, around this time is when I realized i had not  been commiting to the repository, thus leaving no record of the work I had done thus far.

With my lesson learned I continued by consolidating certain classes to further simplify the CSS stylesheet. At this point I also repaired the first link and added a `<figure>` and `<figcaption>` to the background image.

Finally, it was time to publish and submit,
refactored website published live here:
