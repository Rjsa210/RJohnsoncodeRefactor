# Week 1 homework: CodeRefactor
## **Reid Johnson**
### UTSA Web Development Boot Camp

For this weeks assignment I learned several things through my process of refactoring the website.

Initially, I began  by consolidating the .CSS,
combining selectors, and making the code more efficient; while making sure the changes I made maintained the appearance of the website. Also I added alt attributes to all the images

Next, I replaced `<div>` with semantic elements. Ultimately I was able to replace every `<div>` tag in the HTML with an appropriate semantic tag.

While working my way through the HTML, I regularly returned to the CSS to rename selectors with the appropriate updated tags.

Unfortunately, around this time is when I realized i had not  been commiting to the repository, thus leaving no record of the work I had done thus far.

With my lesson learned I continued by consolidating certain classes to further simplify the CSS stylesheet. At this point I also repaired the first link and added a `<figure>` and `<figcaption>` to the background image.

Finally, it was time to publish and submit,
refactored website published live here:
